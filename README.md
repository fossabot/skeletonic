## Getting Started

A few options are available:

-   Download the latest [release](https://github.com/reedia/skeletonic/archive/v1.0.31.zip)
-   Or simply clone the main repo: `git clone https://github.com/reedia/skeletonic.git`

## What's in the box

Within the release you'll find the following directory and external style sheets with both compiled and minified CSS variations:

```
Skeletonic/
├── skeletonic-1.0.31.css
├── skeletonic.min-1.0.31.css
├── skeletonic-pattern-1.0.31.css
├── skeletonic-pattern.min-1.0.31.css
```

You simply then need to link one of these in your HTML document.

The link consists of just a simple line of HTML code that you will need to put in the ```<head>```  section of your HTML document:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="skeletonic-pattern.min-1.0.31.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="skeletonic.min-1.0.31.css" />
```

## Built With
-   [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - The streaming build system
-   [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) - Expressive, robust, feature-rich CSS language built for nodejs
-   [CSScomb](http://csscomb.com/) - CSS coding style formatter
